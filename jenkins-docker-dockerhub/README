           ==================================================
           
           An image with Jenkins, Docker and the Dockhub plugin.

           The Dockerfile will always build the latest Jenkins
           and Docker for the specified base image (Ubuntu 14.04
           by default). The latest plugin is also used.
           
           The Docker daemon and the Jenkins daemon are running
           under Supervisord (a process manager).




================================  Run  =================================

Make sure you are in the same folder as the Dockerfile and run
the below:

  1. docker build --tag="jenkins-docker-dockhub" .
  2. docker run -t --privileged -p 8080:8080 jenkins-docker-dockhub

The -t flag makes sure we can exit the container by hitting CTR+C

If you want your jobs to remain after closing the container then
you should start your container with -v <path on host>:/root/.jenkins/jobs
replacing <path on host> with a folder that will be used for storing the jobs.

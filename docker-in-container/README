           A simple image with docker inside. If you modify
           something, make sure the docker.io service is
           running.



-------------------------------  Run   ---------------------------------
1. docker build --tag="docker-in-container" .
2. docker run -t --privileged docker-in-container

The -t flag makes sure we can exit the container by hitting CTR+C




---------------------------  Description   -----------------------------
This runs a container with docker inside. A dummy "tail -f" command is
followed after starting the docker service. This is done solely to keep
the service alive.

To enter the container and create new containers inside of it you either
have to edit the Dockerfile, use other tools like nsenter or use a
process manager .





----------------------------  Remarks   --------------------------------
If you want nested containers to talk to the host you need to map the
ports correctly from each nested container to its outer container so
that they create a "mapped port" link.

For example for a host <---> cont1 <---> cont2 communication on
port 8000 you want to run consequently the -t flag with the correct
mapping 8000:8000 on the host and cont1.

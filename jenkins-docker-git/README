           ==================================================
           
           An image with Jenkins, Git and Docker, all running
           inside the same container.
           
           It also includes the docker and github plugin.
           
           The Dockerfile will always build the latest Jenkins,
           Git, Docker and their plugins for the specified base
           image (Ubuntu 14.04 by default).
           
           The Docker daemon and the Jenkins daemon are running
           under Supervisord (a process manager).




================================  Run  =================================

Make sure you are in the same folder as the Dockerfile and run
the below:

  1. docker build --tag="jenkins-docker-git" .
  2. docker run -t --privileged -p 8080:8080 jenkins-docker-git

The -t flag makes sure we can exit the container by hitting CTR+C

If you want your jobs to remain after closing the container then
you should start your container with -v <path on host>:/root/.jenkins/jobs
replacing <path on host> with a folder that will be used for storing the jobs.

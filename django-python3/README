           Barebones Django with Python3.
           
           User manos is created but you could create any user that is
           going to be in the host machine. That way, files created
           inside the container and are shared with host, become
           accesible by the user in both the container and the host.




================================  Run  =================================

Make sure you are in the same folder as the Dockerfile and run
the below:

  1. mkdir /home/$USER/django-projects
  2. docker build --tag="django" .
  3. docker run -i -t -p 8000:8000 -u manos -w /home/django-projects -v /home/$USER/django-projects:/home/django-projects django bash


Replace <host src> with the folder with the source code for your django
projects. The source will be mounted at /home/django-projects

The flag -u is used so we login in as the user created in the dockerfile
 (which is manos if you haven't changed it).
 
The flag -w is so we enter the specific directory with the django
projects.
